# AsthmaGuardian-ESP32 _(still under development)_

> _AirQuality-Monitor-ESP32_

An advanced **IoT air quality monitoring system** built with **ESP32** to help protect asthma patients and sensitive individuals.  
It measures **PM2.5**, **temperature**, and **humidity**, sends **WhatsApp alerts** during dangerous air conditions, and **logs data** onto an SD card for long-term analysis.
