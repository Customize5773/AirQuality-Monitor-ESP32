# ðŸ“š Libraries

This `lib/` folder contains any **custom libraries** or **manually added external libraries** used in the **AirQuality-Monitor-ESP32** project.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Folder Structure Example

```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ CustomLibrary1/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ CustomLibrary1.h
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ CustomLibrary1.cpp
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ library.json (optional)
â””â”€â”€ ExternalLibrary2/
    â”œâ”€â”€ ExternalLibrary2.h
    â”œâ”€â”€ ExternalLibrary2.cpp
    â””â”€â”€ library.json (optional)
```

## ðŸ“œ Notes

- Each library should be placed in its **own folder** inside `lib/`.
- If you're using **PlatformIO**, you can also include a `library.json` manifest file for better library management.
- **Custom Libraries** are encouraged if:
  - You create reusable code modules.
  - You want to share standardized features across projects.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Current Status
ðŸ”¹ No custom libraries added yet.  
ðŸ”¹ You can add here later if needed (example: custom Sensor drivers, Alert Systems, etc).

---

> ðŸ“¢ **Tip:**  
> Keep third-party libraries managed separately using Arduino Library Manager or PlatformIO Registry where possible.  
> Only put custom or manually modified libraries inside `/lib/`.
